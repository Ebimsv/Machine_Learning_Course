# About This Project

Welcome to my Machine Learning Course Repository!

This project contains the code and resources for my machine learning course at **Tarbiat Modares University**. Throughout the course, we explore a wide range of topics, including:

- **Supervised Learning**: Techniques for predicting outcomes based on labeled training data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Approaches for analyzing data without labeled responses.
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced methods for modeling complex patterns using neural networks.

## Purpose

The code in this repository is designed to assist students in understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques related to machine learning. Each script includes practical examples and tutorials to facilitate hands-on learning and application to real-world problems.

## Technologies Used

The project is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For standard machine learning algorithms.
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning applications.

## Target Audience

This repository is primarily aimed at students who are new to machine learning. The code is well-documented, providing explanations and comments to ensure clarity for beginners.

## Contribution & Contact

I created this project to share my knowledge and experiences with those interested in learning about machine learning. I hope you find the resources helpful!
